<p>&nbsp;
</p><p>This post is intended as a compendium of current knowledge on farming that 
  has been collected by me (<b>Nerdicus</b>) and <b>Nero Would</b>, with the help 
  of information from <b>Grumpus the Elder</b> and others. 
</p><p><b>Farming Fact #1: Minimum farm fertility is 2% and maximum fertility is 99%</b><br>
  The fertility of a farm is calculated as the average fertility of the 9 squares 
  under the farm plus 2%. If a farm has no meadow squares underneath but is placed 
  with a meadow square touching one edge of the farm, the fertility of that farm 
  will be 2%.
</p><p><b>Farming Fact #2: Irrigation increases the fertility of a meadow farm by 
  40% and a floodplain farm by 20%.</b><br>
  An irrigation ditch must be within at least 2 squares of any square of a farm, 
  and the increase will not push the fertility of the farm over the maximum of 
  99%. Irrigation to floodplain farms does not require a water lift, just start 
  a ditch connected to the river.
</p><p><b>Farming Fact #3: Each farm type is harvested during day #2 of its harvest 
  month.</b><br>
  Each type of farm has a different harvest month and in the case of meadow grain, 
  meadow barley, and meadow pomegranates are harvested twice a year. The harvest 
  month of a floodplain farm is determined by the location of the city on the 
  world map. Typically a city that is far south will have an earlier harvest month 
  (because the inundation comes earlier). All farms send the harvest to the city 
  on the second day of the month. See the table below for the specific harvest 
  months of the various farm types.
</p><p><b>Farming Fact #4: The yield of a farm is 800 * its production % complete.</b><br>
  The yield of a farm on harvest day is its production % complete rounded down 
  to the nearest 1% multiplied by 800. An equivalent equation would be = Min( 
  800, (8 * Floor(Production Complete% * 100))). The function Floor() rounds down 
  to the nearest integer. The function Min() selects the smallest value from a 
  comma delimited list. The blessing of Osiris will double the yield of floodplain 
  farms up to a maximum of 1600. A grain farm (both floodplain and meadow) will 
  produce 100 straw no matter how small a harvest from the farm.
</p><p><b>Farming Fact #5: Each 1/16th of a month a "Daily Gain" is added to a farm's 
  production.</b><br>
  The current production % complete rounded down to the nearest 1% is displayed 
  in the farms information window (right click on farm). Each day (1/16 of a month) 
  the daily gain is added to the production % complete. The daily gain for a farm 
  is calculated as = 0.05% * Max(1, Floor(Fertility% * 103.5 * 20 / 128)). The 
  Max() function selects the largest value from a list and in this case enforces 
  a minimum daily gain of 0.05% regardless of the farm's fertility. Nero Would 
  noticed that this equation is equivalent to a basic farm production rate of 
  103.5 units per month for an ideal (and impossible) 100% fertility farm.
</p><p><b>Farming Fact #6: A shortfall of farm employees affects meadow farm yield.</b><br>
  Like production buildings, a lack of staff causes the farm to yield correspondingly 
  less product. While I have not calculated the exact shortfall I suspect the 
  daily gain is multiplied by the current number of employees/10 (fully staffed 
  meadow farm uses 10 employees). The above would be equivalent to the effects 
  of employee shortfall on production buildings.
</p><p><b>Farming Fact #7: A meadow farm will continue growing even if the cart pusher 
  does not return for harvest.</b><br>
  This is especially interesting for the biannual meadow farms. A meadow farm 
  will continue growing up to 100% complete even if its cart pusher does not make 
  it back for the next harvest. I typically have the barley meadow farms deliver 
  their goods directly to the breweries. If I am overproducing barley, sometimes 
  a cart pusher will not be able to deliver the barley and then return to the 
  farm. Once he does return, the meadow farm will wait until the next harvest 
  month before sending the cart pusher out with two harvests worth of product 
  (up to the maximum of 800 units). For lower fertility meadow farms this means 
  you can treat a biannual farm just like it was an annual farms for calculations 
  like maximum distance to deliver goods.
</p><p><b>The Farm Production Yield Table</b><br>
  I have designed this table to (hopefully) make calculating the expected yield 
  of a farm easier. To use the table, just find the row with the farm's fertility 
  and then move over to the column that describes the type of farm. The value 
  at this location is the exact amount of product that you should expect when 
  the farm is harvested. This value is the maximum and will only be reached when 
  the farm has had a full staff for the entire season and started growing at the 
  beginning of this growing season. Note that the biannual farms have <b>two</b> 
  growing seasons per year and for some farm types the seasons are of different 
  lengths. I would like to hear from anyone who has comments or has detected errors 
  in the following. Im not great at color schemes or layout so comments on that 
  are free game too.<br>
